### Objective

You must implement a function which plots the data, the prediction line, and the loss. You will plot the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of all data points as well as the prediction line generated by your theta parameters. Your function must also display the overall loss ($J$) in the title, and draw small lines marking the distance between each data point and its predicted value.
