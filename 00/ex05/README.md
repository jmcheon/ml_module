For you information, the task we are performing here is called regression. It means that we are trying to predict a continuous numerical attribute for all examples (like a price, for instance). Later in the bootcamp, you will see that we can predict other things such as categories.

### Objective

You must implement a function to plot the data and the prediction line (or regression line). You will plot the data points (with their x and y values), and the prediction line that represents your hypothesis ($h_θ$).
