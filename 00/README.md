# Machine Learning Module 00

> ***Summary : You will start by reviewing some linear algebra and statistics. Then you will implement your first model and learn how to evaluate its performances.***

| Exercise |           Title            |                         Description                          |
| :------: | :------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|    00    |         The Matrix         |  Manipulation and understanding of basic matrix operations.  |
|    01    |      TinyStatistician      |         Initiation to very basic statistic notions.          |
|    02    |     Simple Prediction      | Understand and manipulate the notion of hypothesis in machine learning.<br/>You must implement the following formula as a function:<br/> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40683323/235980403-aa2bc891-df8a-4f46-8738-43bbe68e2f6d.png) for i = 1, ..., m|
|    03    |       Add Intercept        | Understand and manipulate the notion of hypothesis in machine learning.<br/>You must implement a function which adds an extra column of 1’s on the left side of a given vector or matrix. |
|    04    |         Prediction         | Understand and manipulate the notion of hypothesis in machine learning.<br/>You must implement the following formula as a function:<br/> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40683323/235980403-aa2bc891-df8a-4f46-8738-43bbe68e2f6d.png) for i = 1, ..., m |
|    05    |   Let’s Make Nice Plots    | You must implement a function to plot the data and the prediction line (or regression line).<br/>You will plot the data points (with their x and y values), and the prediction line that represents your hypothesis (hθ). |
|    06    |       Loss function        | Understand and manipulate the notion of loss function in machine learning. |
|    07    |  Vectorized loss function  | Understand and manipulate the notion of loss function in machine learning. |
|    08    | Lets Make Nice Plots Again | You must implement a function which plots the data, the prediction line, and the loss. |
|    09    |    Other loss functions    |   Deepen the notion of loss function in machine learning.    |
