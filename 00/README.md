# Machine Learning Module 00

> ***Summary : You will start by reviewing some linear algebra and statistics. Then you will implement your first model and learn how to evaluate its performances.***

| Exercise |           Title            |                         Description                          |
| :------: | :------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|    00    |         The Matrix         |  Manipulation and understanding of basic matrix operations.  |
|    01    |      TinyStatistician      |         Initiation to very basic statistic notions.          |
|    02    |     Simple Prediction      | Understand and manipulate the notion of hypothesis in machine learning. |
|    03    |       Add Intercept        | Understand and manipulate the notion of hypothesis in machine learning. |
|    04    |         Prediction         | Understand and manipulate the notion of hypothesis in machine learning. |
|    05    |   Letâ€™s Make Nice Plots    | You must implement a function to plot the data and the prediction line (or regression line). |
|    06    |       Loss function        | Understand and manipulate the notion of loss function in machine learning. |
|    07    |  Vectorized loss function  | Understand and manipulate the notion of loss function in machine learning. |
|    08    | Lets Make Nice Plots Again | You must implement a function which plots the data, the prediction line, and the loss. |
|    09    |    Other loss functions    |   Deepen the notion of loss function in machine learning.    |
