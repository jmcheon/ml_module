### Objective

Understand and manipulate the notion of loss function in machine learning. You must implement the following formula as a function:
$$J(Î¸) = \frac{1}{2m} (\hat{y} - y)\cdot(\hat{y} - y) $$

Where:

 - $\hat{y}$ is a vector of dimension $m$, the vector of predicted values
 - $y$ is a vector of dimension $m$, the vector of expected values
