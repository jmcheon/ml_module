### Objective

Learn how to split a dataset into a **training set** and a **test set**.

### Instructions
You must implement a function that **shuffles** and **splits** a dataset it in two parts: a **training set** and a **test set**.
 - Your function will shuffle and split the $X$ matrix while keeping a certain **proportion** of the examples for training, and the rest for testing.
 - Your function will also shuffle and split the $y$ vector while making sure that the order of the rows in the output match the order of the rows in the split $X$ output
