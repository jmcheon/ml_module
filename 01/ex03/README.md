### Objective

Write a class that contains all methods necessary to perform linear regression.

### Instructions
In this exercise, you will not learn anything new but don’t worry, it’s for your own good. You are expected to write your own **MyLinearRegression** class which looks similar to the class available in Scikit-learn: **sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression**


You will add the following methods:

 - fit_(self, x, y)
 - predict_(self, x)
 - loss_elem_(self, y, y_hat)
 - loss_(self, y, y_hat)

&emsp; You have already implemented these functions, you just need a few adjustments so that they all work well within your **MyLinearRegression** class.
