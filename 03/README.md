# Machine Learning Module 03 - Logistic Regression

> ***Summary : Discover your first classification algorithm: logistic regression. You will learn its loss function, gradient descent and some metrics to evaluate its performance.***

| Exercise |               Title               |                         Description                          |
| :------: | :-------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|    00    |              Sigmoid              | Introduction to the hypothesis notion in case of logistic regression. |
|    01    |        Logistic Hypothesis        | Introduction to the hypothesis notion in case of logistic regression. |
|    02    |      Logistic Loss Function       | Understanding and manipulation loss function concept in case of logistic regression. |
|    03    | Vectorized Logistic Loss Function | Understanding and manipulation loss function concept in case of logistic regression. |
|    04    |         Logistic Gradient         | Understand and manipulate concept of gradient in the case of logistic formulation. |
|    05    |   Vectorized Logistic Gradient    | Understand and manipulate concept of gradient in the case of logistic formulation. |
|    06    |        Logistic Regression        | Demonstrate your knowledge by implementing a logistic regression classifier using the gradient descent algorithm. <br />You must have seen the power of numpy for vectorized operations. |
|    07    |  Practicing Logistic Regression   | Now itâ€™s time to test your Logistic Regression Classifier on real data!<br /> You will use the solar_system_census_dataset. |
|    08    |           Other metrics           | Understanding and manipulation of classification criteria (TP, FP, ...) and metrics.<br /> The goal of this exercise is to write four metric functions (which are also available in sklearn.metrics) and to understand what they measure and how they are constructed. |
|    09    |         Confusion Matrix          | Manipulation of confusion matrix concept.<br /> The goal of this exercise is to reimplement the function confusion_matrix available in<br /> sklearn.metrics and to learn what does the confusion matrix represent. |
