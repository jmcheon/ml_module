### Objective

Introduction to the hypothesis notion in case of logistic regression. You must implement the sigmoid function, given by the following formula:
$$\text {sigmoid}(x) = \frac {1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$

Where:

 - $x$ is a scalar or a vector,
 - $e$ is the contracted form for exponential function. It is also a mathematical constant, named Eulerâ€™s number.

&emsp;This function is also known as **Standard logistic sigmoid function**. This explains the name *logistic regression*.
&emsp;The sigmoid function transforms an input into a probability value, i.e. a value between 0 and 1. This probability value will then be used to classify the inputs.
